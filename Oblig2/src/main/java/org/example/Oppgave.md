Each project will be based on some form of existing framework: either there are existing solutions that provide similar functionality, or there are solutions that you solution can be built on. These have to be studied in order to make the right choice for your projects. 

- Decide on a set of existing frameworks and or libraries that offer functionality similar to what you want to provide with your framework 
(or you are interested in if you haven't decided on a framework).

- Decide on a set of principles to compare the existing solutions. 
These should be based on the theory in the course (high-level design principles, design patterns, ...). 
These doesn't have to be described in detail in the report, but you should list the relevant principles followed.

- Decide on a set of important/interesting scenarios (Ideally something similar to the scenarios planned for the next mandatory assignment) for which to write client code.

- Write the client code that solves the scenarios

- Compare the code in relation to the principles by which to compare.

This assignment will serve as the "background" in your final reports, and allows for easy comparison with your libraries.

The results should be collected in a pdf-report. Structure the information as

1. Short on principles for comparison
2. Solutions
   1. Scenarios
