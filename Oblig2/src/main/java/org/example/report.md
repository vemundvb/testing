# Scenarios I want to compare

To compare the frameworks/libraries, I will use some scenarios I’ve already come up with.

I will use these scenarios to compare the frameworks/libraries:

1. Get the title, content, and image-link of a news article from a CNN.
2. Convert a part of the  HTML code into JSON
3. Use the top search bar on Aftenposten.no, to earch for the topic "Halden", and extract the HTML document from the result.
    Include your user-agent and a timeout in your request.

# Libraries and/or frameworks I will compare2

The scenarios written above, are within the following topics:

Formatting - ex JSON, CVS…

webscraping

Frameworks/libraries that cover these functionalities are:

Webscraping:

- Nutch
- Jsoup
- Jaunt

Formatting:

- ASPOSE
- JSON-lib
- GSON

# Principles I want to compare with

Principle of least astonishment:

This is about that the user can use the framework in an excepted

Powerfull and easy:

This is about that the framwork should be easy to use.

That easy things should be easy to do, and harder things should be possible to do.
